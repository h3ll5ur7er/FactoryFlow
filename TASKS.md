## Dependencies

### Core Domain Models
- No dependencies, can be implemented first

### Graph System
- Depends on Core Domain Models

### Plugin System
- Depends on Core Domain Models
- Partially depends on Graph System for node types

### Calculation Engine
- Depends on Core Domain Models
- Depends on Graph System
- Depends on Plugin System for game data

### File Management
- Depends on Core Domain Models
- Depends on Graph System
- Depends on Plugin System references

### UI Implementation
- Depends on all other systems
- Should be implemented last

## Implementation Order
1. Core Domain Models
2. Graph System
3. Plugin System
4. Calculation Engine
5. File Management
6. UI Implementation

Each task should:
- Start with a failing test (except UI tasks)
- Implement minimum required functionality
- Include proper documentation
- Follow SOLID principles
- Be reviewed before merging
